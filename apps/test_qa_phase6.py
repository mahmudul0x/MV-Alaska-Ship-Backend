"""QA Phase 6 — Invoice / PDF generation probes.

Drives the real invoice code (apps.bookings.invoices) end-to-end and reads the
generated PDFs back with PyMuPDF, so every assertion is about what a customer
actually receives — not about what the code intends.

Probes named *_FIXED_* pin a bug that was found and fixed: each one FAILED
before the fix and passes now, so a regression on any of them reopens the
finding. See qa-reports/phase6-invoice-pdf.md.
