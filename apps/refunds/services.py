"""State transitions for cancellations and refunds.

Every function here is the ONLY supported way to move the state it owns, and
every one of them takes the booking's row lock first. Two staff working the same
queue, or a customer double-submitting the confirm screen, must not be able to
cancel a booking twice or raise two payouts for the same money — the partial
unique constraints in models.py are the backstop, these locks are the front
door.

Nothing here recomputes a customer's quote from the live schedule: the figures
frozen on the request at submission time are what get honoured. The single
exception is documented in ``approve_cancellation`` (money that arrived AFTER
the quote), and it can only ever move the refund up.
