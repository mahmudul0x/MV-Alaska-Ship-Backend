    what stops a paid room being resold), and the reconciliation job backs off
    from escalated rows. Without a human control the cabin is out of inventory
    permanently. So staff, having checked the SSLCommerz merchant panel, can:

    - CLOSE it (FAILED/CANCELLED) — the gateway confirms no money moved; the

    - SETTLE it (SUCCESS) — money did move; credit the customer, which flows
      through refresh_paid_amount() exactly like a gateway settlement.
