"""Invoice PDF generation + email delivery.

Issued after a successful payment (PRD §5.6). PDF text is shaped with HarfBuzz
(fpdf2), so Bengali and English both render correctly using the bundled Noto
fonts in backend/assets/fonts.

An issued invoice is an immutable financial record:

- The money it states (total/paid/due/status) is frozen onto the Invoice row
  at issue time, so the PDF and its covering email can never contradict each
  other, and a resend cannot silently restate an old invoice's numbers.
- The line items come from Booking.price_snapshot — the itemisation frozen
  when the booking was priced — never from today's (admin-editable) pricing
  rules, which would re-price an already-paid booking.
